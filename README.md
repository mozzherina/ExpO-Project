# ExpO Project

This folder is for projects developed towards **EXP**laining **O**ntology-driven conceptual models.

Please, note that **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**. Thus:
* the software contains bugs;
* the version running on the server may be different from the distribution in the corresponding GitHub folder;
* we continuously update the system.

Three main components of the system are:
1. Expose -- the server that accepts API calls and applies model transformations.
   The server is running [here](https://expose.eng.unibz.it/health).
   The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/mozzherina/ExpO-Project/blob/dbac7f57108a854ab35002126a78d1098b79be96/Expose/README.md).
   The GitHub project is located [here](https://github.com/mozzherina/Expose).
2. ExpO -- web application for model explanation.
   The interface is running [here](https://expo.eng.unibz.it). Please, use **Chrome** and **large screen**. 
   The documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/mozzherina/ExpO-Project/blob/dbac7f57108a854ab35002126a78d1098b79be96/Expo/README.md).
   The GitHub project is located [here](https://github.com/mozzherina/ExpO).
3. OntoUML and ExpO plugin for [Visual Paradigm](https://visual-paradigm.com/).
   The GitHub project is located [here](https://github.com/mozzherina/ontouml-vp-plugin). For the version with ExpO functionality, please, use the release **v0.1.0-expo**.

If you are interested in knowing more, feel free to open an issue to provide feedback on the project or reach our team members for more specific cases:
